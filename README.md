PulseGuard is the first predictive safety wearable designed to protect young adults (ages 14-24) from drink tampering incidents. By combining modified NASA technologies, we've created a system that doesn't just react to dangerâ€”it predicts it.
ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement
There is a critical need for a predictive risk interception system that helps families protect adolescents and young adults from drink tampering and spiking incidents in social environments.
ðŸ’¡ Our Solution
PulseGuard combines two adapted NASA technologies to create a comprehensive safety system:

Modified Nanomaterial VOC Sensors (originally NASA breath analysis tech)

Detects chemical signatures when date-rape drugs mix with beverages
Scans the air above drinks for volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
Provides pre-consumption warnings


Heart Rate ID Biometric Monitoring (originally NASA authentication tech)

Analyzes 192+ ECG features to establish user baseline
Detects stress and abnormal heart activity patterns
Monitors physiological distress signals post-ingestion



ðŸ”¬ Demo Features
This repository contains a simulation environment that demonstrates:

Gas Content Monitoring: Simulates elevated VOC levels when tampering is detected
Heart Rate Spike Detection: Monitors and responds to abnormal heart rate patterns
Emergency Alert System: Automatically sends email notifications to emergency contacts when risk thresholds are exceeded
Real-time Dashboard: Visual interface showing current safety metrics
